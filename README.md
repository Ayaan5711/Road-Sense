# Road-Sense: A Smart Traffic Monitoring System

## Overview

**Road-Sense** is a real-time traffic monitoring and speed estimation system designed to process video input from traffic cameras. The system utilizes advanced technologies to provide comprehensive traffic analysis, including object detection, speed estimation, vehicle type differentiation, and congestion detection. Built using YOLO for object detection, OpenVINO for accelerated inference, and custom logic for various traffic monitoring features, Road-Sense enhances traffic management and safety.

## Features

### Real-time Object Detection and Tracking
- Detects and tracks vehicles (car, motorcycle, bus, truck) from live traffic camera feeds.
- Provides a real-time count of vehicles in each lane.

### Speed Estimation
- Calculates and displays the speed of each detected vehicle.
- Alerts when vehicles exceed the speed limit.

### Vehicle Type Differentiation
- Differentiates between various types of vehicles.
- Displays counts by vehicle type for detailed traffic analysis.

### Traffic Congestion Detection
- Monitors traffic density in each zone.
- Detects and alerts when congestion is identified.

### Zone-Based Vehicle Heatmaps
- Generates heatmaps to visualize vehicle activity across different zones.
- Facilitates zone-specific traffic pattern analysis.

### Proximity Alerts
- Detects when vehicles are too close to each other.
- Provides on-screen and backend alerts with distance and zone information.
